## 🐛 Issues Discovered & Fixed

### 🚨 Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. Permission System Bugs
**Issue:** Supplier users getting 403 Forbidden when creating products
```python
# Problem: ProductListCreateView used IsAdminOrReadOnly permission
permission_classes = [IsAdminOrReadOnly]

# Solution: Added dynamic permission override
def get_permissions(self):
    if self.request.method == 'POST':
        return [IsSupplierOrAdmin()]  # Allow suppliers to create
    return [IsAdminOrReadOnly()]     # Admin-only for list view
```
**Impact:** Fixed supplier product creation functionality

#### 2. Model Relationship Errors  
**Issue:** `prefetch_related('supplier_prices')` invalid relationship
```python
# Problem: Incorrect relationship path
queryset = Product.objects.prefetch_related('supplier_prices')

# Solution: Fixed to proper relationship path  
queryset = Product.objects.prefetch_related('variants__supplier_prices')
```
**Impact:** Eliminated database query errors

#### 3. Serializer Field Mismatches
**Issue:** `select_related('product')` on SupplierProductPrice queryset
```python
# Problem: Wrong field name
queryset = SupplierProductPrice.objects.select_related('product')

# Solution: Corrected to match model field
queryset = SupplierProductPrice.objects.select_related('product_variant')
```
**Impact:** Fixed supplier price list endpoint

#### 4. Field Name Inconsistencies
**Issue:** Tests using `base_price` field which doesn't exist
```python
# Problem: Wrong field name
'base_price': '25.99'

# Solution: Corrected to actual model field
'price': '25.99'
```
**Impact:** Product creation tests now work correctly
