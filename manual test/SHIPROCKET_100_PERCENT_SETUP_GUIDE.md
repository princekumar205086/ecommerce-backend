## Step-by-Step Setup for 100% Success

### Step 1: ShipRocket Dashboard Setup
1. **Login to ShipRocket**: https://app.shiprocket.in
   - Email: `your-shiprocket-email@example.com`
   - Password: `your-shiprocket-password`

2. **Add Pickup Address**:
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pickup Addresses**
   - Click **Add New Address**
   - Enter details:
     ```
     Name: MedixMall
     Email: pickup@medixmall.com
     Phone: 9876543210
     Address: 123 Test Street, Business Park
     City: Purnia
     State: Bihar
     PIN Code: 854301
     Country: India
     ```
   - Set as **Primary Address**
   - **Save** the address

3. **Verify Address**:
   - ShipRocket will verify the address
   - This usually takes a few minutes
   - You'll get a confirmation email

### Step 2: Test Order Creation After Setup

After setting up the pickup address, run this test:

```bash
python test_shiprocket.py
```

Expected result after setup:
```
‚úÖ ShipRocket authentication successful!
‚úÖ Serviceability check successful!
‚úÖ Shipping rates retrieved successfully!  
‚úÖ Order creation successful!
‚úÖ Order tracking successful!
```

### Step 3: Alternative Test (If Dashboard Access Needed)

If you need me to help set up the pickup address, you can:

1. **Provide Dashboard Access**: Share ShipRocket dashboard screenshot
2. **API Setup**: I can help configure the pickup location via API
3. **Manual Verification**: We can verify the address manually

### Step 4: Complete Production Test

Once pickup address is set up, run the complete test:

```bash
python production_order_test.py
```

This will give us 100% success across all systems.

## Quick Fix Option

If you want to proceed immediately, I can:

1. **Update the pickup location** in our config to match an existing verified address
2. **Test with different pickup PINs** that might already be verified
3. **Use ShipRocket's default pickup locations**

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Help you set up the pickup address in ShipRocket dashboard
- **B)** Try alternative pickup locations that might already be verified
- **C)** Create a test order with a different configuration

Which option would you prefer to achieve 100% ShipRocket success?
