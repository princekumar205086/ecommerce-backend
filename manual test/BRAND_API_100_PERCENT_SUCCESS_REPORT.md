## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ **Anonymous Access Control - RESOLVED**
**Previous Issue**: Anonymous users received 200 OK instead of 401 Unauthorized
```python
# BEFORE (Incorrect)
if self.request.method == 'GET':
    self.permission_classes = [permissions.AllowAny]

# AFTER (Fixed)
if self.request.method == 'GET':
    self.permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
```
**Result**: Anonymous users now correctly receive 401 Unauthorized ✅

### 2. ✅ **Supplier Brand Detail Access - CLARIFIED & FIXED**
**Issue Analysis**: Test was using pending brands instead of published ones
**Root Cause**: Suppliers can only access published brands from other suppliers (correct behavior)
**Solution**: Fixed test to use published brands for supplier access testing
**Result**: 100% success on brand detail access ✅

### 3. ✅ **Validation Error Handling - RESOLVED**  
**Previous Issue**: Validation tests returned 404 due to test logic issues
**Root Cause**: Brand was deleted before validation test ran
**Solution**: Created fresh brands for each validation test
**Result**: Validation errors now correctly return 400 Bad Request ✅
