# Production Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Identified:

1. **Environment Variables Not Loading**: The `.env` file wasn't being loaded by Django
2. **Static Files Not Served**: When DEBUG=False, Django doesn't serve static files automatically
3. **Security Headers Blocking Content**: Some security settings were too restrictive
4. **Missing Static File Collection**: Static files weren't properly collected for production

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated `ecommerce/settings.py`:
- Added `python-dotenv` import and `load_dotenv()` to load environment variables
- Fixed static files configuration
- Improved security settings (changed X_FRAME_OPTIONS from DENY to SAMEORIGIN)
- Added better static file handling for production

### 2. Updated `ecommerce/urls.py`:
- Added manual static file serving for production
- Improved URL patterns for static files

### 3. Updated `.env` file:
- Temporarily set DEBUG=True for testing
- Commented out problematic security settings

## Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: On Your Local Machine
1. The code changes have been made
2. Test locally to ensure everything works

### Step 2: Deploy to Your Server
1. Upload all the changed files to your server
2. Make sure python-dotenv is installed: `pip install python-dotenv`

### Step 3: On Your Production Server
Run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear

# Run system checks
python manage.py check

# Restart your web server (nginx/gunicorn/etc)
sudo systemctl restart your-web-server
```

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables
On your server, create/update the `.env` file:

```bash
# For production, set DEBUG=False after confirming everything works
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key-here

# Add other environment variables as needed
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=private_BwSqW2hnr3Y6Z3t7p7UWujf+F7o=
IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=public_s1TO0E+T48MD2OOcrPPT3v9K75k=
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/medixmall
```

## Testing:

After deployment, test these URLs:
- ✅ Home: https://backend.okpuja.in/
- ✅ Swagger: https://backend.okpuja.in/swagger/
- ✅ Admin: https://backend.okpuja.in/admin/

## Troubleshooting:

If issues persist:

1. **Check Server Logs**: Look at your web server logs for errors
2. **Static Files**: Ensure the staticfiles directory exists and has proper permissions
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify .env file is in the correct location
4. **Web Server Config**: Make sure your nginx/apache is configured to serve static files

## Alternative Solution (If Above Doesn't Work):

You can use WhiteNoise to serve static files in production:

1. Install WhiteNoise: `pip install whitenoise`
2. Add to MIDDLEWARE in settings.py (after SecurityMiddleware):
   ```python
   'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
   ```
3. Add to settings.py:
   ```python
   STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
   ```

This is a more robust solution for serving static files in production.
