## Payment Flow

### Traditional Online Payment Flow
1. Cart â†’ Payment Creation â†’ Payment Verification â†’ Order Creation

### COD Payment Flow
1. Cart â†’ COD Payment Creation (pending) â†’ COD Confirmation â†’ Order Creation

### COD Flow Details

#### Step 1: COD Payment Creation
- User selects COD as payment method
- Provides shipping address
- Optionally saves address to profile
- Payment record created with status 'pending'
- Order is NOT created yet

#### Step 2: COD Confirmation
- Admin/System confirms COD order
- Payment status updated to 'cod_confirmed'
- Order is automatically created
- Cart is cleared
- User and admin receive notifications

## Address Handling

### Address Auto-fill Logic
1. **If user has saved address**: Auto-fill shipping address from profile
2. **Shipping = Billing**: Shipping address automatically used as billing address
3. **Save Option**: User can choose to update their profile with new address

### Address Validation
Required fields for shipping address:
- `full_name`
- `address_line_1`
- `city`
- `state`
- `postal_code`
- `country`

Optional fields:
- `address_line_2`

## Database Changes

### User Model (accounts/models.py)
```python
# Address fields
address_line_1 = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
address_line_2 = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
city = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
state = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
postal_code = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
country = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
```

### Payment Model (payments/models.py)
```python
# COD support
PAYMENT_METHOD_CHOICES = [
    ('credit_card', 'Credit Card'),
    ('debit_card', 'Debit Card'),
    ('net_banking', 'Net Banking'),
    ('upi', 'UPI'),
    ('cod', 'Cash on Delivery'),
]

PAYMENT_STATUS_CHOICES = [
    ('pending', 'Pending'),
    ('processing', 'Processing'),
    ('completed', 'Completed'),
    ('failed', 'Failed'),
    ('cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
    ('cod_confirmed', 'COD Confirmed'),
]

# COD specific fields
cod_confirmed_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
cod_notes = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
```

## Testing

## Migrations Applied

### accounts_0003_user_address_fields
- Added address fields to User model

### payments_0003_payment_cod_fields
- Added COD method to payment choices
- Added cod_confirmed status
- Added cod_confirmed_at timestamp
- Added cod_notes field

## Usage Examples

### 1. Customer Places COD Order
```javascript
// 1. Create COD payment
const codPayment = await fetch('/api/payments/create-from-cart/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        cart_id: 123,
        payment_method: 'cod',
        shipping_address: {
            full_name: 'John Doe',
            address_line_1: '123 Main St',
            city: 'Mumbai',
            state: 'Maharashtra',
            postal_code: '400001',
            country: 'India'
        },
        save_address_to_profile: true
    })
});

const codData = await codPayment.json();
// COD payment created, awaiting confirmation
```

### 2. Admin Confirms COD Order
```javascript
// 2. Confirm COD payment (admin action)
const confirmation = await fetch('/api/payments/confirm-cod/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + adminToken,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        payment_id: codData.payment_id,
        cod_notes: 'Customer confirmed via phone call'
    })
});

const orderData = await confirmation.json();
// Order created automatically
```

## Security Considerations

### COD Confirmation Access
- Only authenticated admin users can confirm COD payments
- COD confirmation includes audit trail (notes, timestamp)
- Payment status changes are logged

### Address Data Protection
- Address data stored securely in user profile
- GDPR compliant address handling
- User can update/delete saved addresses

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **User Experience**:
   - Simplified checkout for COD customers
   - Address auto-fill for returning customers
   - No payment gateway integration needed for COD

2. **Business Operations**:
   - Admin control over COD order confirmation
   - Reduced payment gateway fees for COD orders
   - Better order management and fulfillment

3. **Technical Benefits**:
   - Consistent payment flow architecture
   - Reusable address management system
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Future Enhancements

1. **COD Verification**:
   - SMS/Email OTP for COD confirmation
   - Phone verification before order confirmation

2. **Advanced Address Management**:
   - Multiple saved addresses per user
   - Address book with nicknames
   - Delivery preferences per address

3. **COD Analytics**:
   - COD conversion rates
   - COD abandonment tracking
   - Regional COD preferences

## Conclusion

The COD implementation provides a complete cash-on-delivery solution with:
- âœ… Address management and persistence
- âœ… Payment-first flow architecture
- âœ… Admin confirmation workflow
- âœ… Comprehensive testing
- âœ… Clean API design
- âœ… Database migrations
