### ❌ **Failed Test Cases (4/15)**

#### 1. Medicine Product Creation (Admin) - ❌ FAILED
```json
Status: 400 Bad Request
Response: {
  "medicine_details": {
    "batch_number": ["This field is required."]
  }
}
```
**Issue:** The medicine_details serializer requires `batch_number` field  
**Impact:** Medicine products cannot be created without batch numbers  
**Fix Required:** Include batch_number in medicine product creation payload

#### 2-4. GET Product Detail Tests - ❌ FAILED (3 tests)
```json
Status: 404 Not Found  
Response: {"detail": "No Product matches the given query."}
```
**Issue:** Attempting to retrieve non-existent product IDs (462, 463, 464)
