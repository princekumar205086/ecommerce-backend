## üîß Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing POST Method in Swagger Documentation

**Problem:**  
The `UserAddressView` class did not have a POST method, so the Swagger documentation didn't show how to create a new address. Only GET, PUT, and DELETE methods were available.

**Solution:**  
Added a `post()` method to `UserAddressView` with proper `@swagger_auto_schema` decorator.

**Code Changes:**
```python
@swagger_auto_schema(
    manual_parameters=[AUTH_HEADER_PARAMETER],
    request_body=UpdateAddressSerializer,
    responses={
        201: openapi.Response(
            description="Address created successfully",
            examples={
                "application/json": {
                    "message": "Address created successfully",
                    "address": {
                        "address_line_1": "123 Main Street",
                        "address_line_2": "Apt 4B",
                        "city": "Mumbai",
                        "state": "Maharashtra",
                        "postal_code": "400001",
                        "country": "India",
                        "has_address": True,
                        "full_address": "123 Main Street, Apt 4B, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400001, India"
                    }
                }
            },
        ),
        400: "Invalid input",
        401: "Unauthorized",
    },
    operation_description="Create/Save a new address for the user"
)
def post(self, request):
    serializer = UpdateAddressSerializer(data=request.data)
    if serializer.is_valid():
        # Update user address
        user = request.user
        for field, value in serializer.validated_data.items():
            setattr(user, field, value)
        user.save()
        
        # Return updated address
        address_serializer = UserAddressSerializer(user)
        return Response({
            'message': 'Address created successfully',
            'address': address_serializer.data
        }, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
    else:
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
